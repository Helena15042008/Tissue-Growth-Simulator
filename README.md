# Tissue Growth Simulator (Advanced)

## Overview
An interactive web app modeling tissue growth using a nutrient-limited logistic equation. Designed for educational use and biomedical modeling outreach.

## Biological Model
The simulator is based on a modified logistic growth model:

dT/dt = r * T * (1 - T / K(N))  
where K(N) = K0 * N / (N + Km)

- T: Tissue mass or cell density  
- r: Growth rate  
- K(N): Nutrient-dependent carrying capacity  
- K0, Km: Model constants for scaffold and nutrient dynamics

## Features
- Adjustable biological inputs (growth rate, nutrients, cell density)
- Graph of tissue growth over time
- Interactive Streamlit sliders for parameters

## Installation
Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app locally:

streamlit run simulator_app.py

## Deployment
Upload to GitHub and deploy using Streamlit Cloud.
